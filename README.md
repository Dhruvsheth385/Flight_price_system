# ✈️ Flight Fare Prediction - Flask Web App

## 📌 Overview
This is a Flask web application that predicts the fare of a flight ticket based on user-provided features. It uses a Machine Learning model trained on historical flight fare data to provide accurate predictions.

## 🎯 Motivation
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I took the opportunity to learn about Machine Learning and explore the mathematics behind various supervised learning algorithms. To apply my knowledge and build something meaningful, I created this real-world project to predict flight fares using ML and Flask.
